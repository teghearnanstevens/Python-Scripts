Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

I saw the power of functions in my final project. I really could see their different functions that they preformed and 
how easy it was to read code when it is split into functions. Then when there is a bug in a part of your program you can 
find the function which is pretty much a group of code that completes a task and locate and fix the bug quick. I was able to 
fix up my scraping bot easly thanks to functions. 


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

In my judgment the value of test functions is huge. They allow you to see if your functions are getting the correct
outputs. Which is amazingly handy for finding and fixing problems that always arise. It's a critical
part of debugging. 


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

I first find the problem code function, I mark it with a comment. Then I make a test function and test the output to see if the output is correct. If not then I check 
my logic, "Does everything make sense?", "Do I have proper syntax?", "Do I get an error code? If so what does it mean?". I think something I could improve is to run through my logic in my head, and or get a second 
option. Like asking a friend, classmate, and or professor for help.
