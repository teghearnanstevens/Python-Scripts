print(f"""The other day, I was really in trouble. It all started when I saw a very
{adjective} {animal} {verb1} down the hallway. "{Exclamation}!" I yelled. But all
I could think to do was to {verb2} over and over. Miraculously,
that caused it to stop, but not before it tried to {verb3}
right in front of my family. I grabbed it by the {noun1}, but it squirmed away! 
As my family screamed in horror, the {animal} {verb4} all over the room. 
I quickly grabbed a {noun2} and proceeded to {verb5} the {animal} till it 
{adjective2} died on the couch. I'm not sure my family will be able to mentally recover from this.""")
